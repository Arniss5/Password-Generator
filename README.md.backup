## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Choose how long the password should be and whether it should include symbols
- Click on the button to see two generated passwords
- Click on a 'copy' icon to copy the password to their clipboard
- See hover effects on varied elements
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Fontawesome
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/NEj9JDycMjF3XKXq7swoc9/Random-Password-Generator-(New-version)?node-id=0%3A1) - For styles


### What I learned

With this app I practiced JS functions with the use of conditionals and iteration. I learned how to enable user to copy to clipboard with a single click. I got more experience manipulating the DOM, creating event listeners and rendering text depending on user input. I used Math methods.



```js
 for (let i = 0; i < passLength; i++) {
        //check if symbols is checked
        if (includeSymbols) {
            //get random character including symbols
            randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length)
            //get random character excluding symbols
        } else {
            randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * 62) 
        }
}
```


```js
navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText)
```



### Continued development

I am planning to continue focusing on writing JavaScript functions and start designing more complex applications.
